  <h2>Mike's Pet</h2>
  <p>I used to have a hedgehog, his name was Phteven.</p>
  <p> He's not like a porcupine, this is what makes hedgehogs different:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Hedgehogs have spikes, not quills</li>
    <li>Hedgehogs cannot shoot their spikes</li>
    <li>Hedgehogs poop a lot</li> 
  </ul>
